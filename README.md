# Phishing-Email-Analysis
In This I found that the above email is a phishing attempt disguised as a message from MS Outlook Support. It claims that all Hotmail accounts have been upgraded to Outlook and warns the recipient that their account services have expired. To maintain access, the recipient is instructed to click a link to “Re-activate” their account.
Phishing Email Analysis Report

Sample Email

Email pretending to be from MS Outlook Support.

Sender’s Email Address

info@outlook-support.dk

Suspicious because Microsoft uses official domains like @outlook.com or @microsoft.com.

The .dk country code (Denmark) is unrelated to Microsoft’s main operations.

Email Headers

Not visible in screenshot.

Likely mismatched “From” and “Return-Path” domains.

Suspicious Links/Attachments

Link displayed as https://www.account.live.com (could be a disguise; needs hover check).

The visible link may not match the actual redirect URL.

No attachments shown, but link is suspicious.

Urgent/Threatening Language

States: “Your Hotmail Account services has expired” — creates urgency and fear of losing access.

Encourages immediate action to "Re-activate" account.

Mismatched URLs

Needs hover test; possible mismatch between visible link and real destination.

Attackers often use similar-looking domains to trick users.

Spelling/Grammar Errors

“services has expired” — incorrect grammar (should be “services have expired”).

Inconsistent capitalization: “Sign in Re-activate” is awkward.

Summary of Phishing Traits

Suspicious sender domain not associated with Microsoft.

Urgent language pushing user to click link.

Potential mismatched URL.

Grammar errors indicate lack of professionalism.

Generic greeting (“Dear User”) instead of addressing recipient by name.
